\title{Attempts to scrape/extract bibliographic data from Web of Science.}
\usage{

}
\arguments{
\item{DOI}{A string as the DOI (digital object identifier) of a research article.}

\item{quiet}{When \code{TRUE}, does not print an MLA-style reference of the
extracted article.}
}
\value{
A list of bibliographic extractions and a timestamp of the scrape.

\description{
A not so elegant way to extract bibliographic data of a research article by
scraping the contents of Web of Science (WOS).  Requires the DOI (digital
object identifier) of an article, as well as web access with an institutional
subscription to WOS.  Note: This function is not suited to extract data
for book chapters available on WOS.  Current extractions include: a vector
of authors (author), publication year (year), article title (title), journal
title (journal), journal volume (volume), page numbers (pages), abstract
(abstract), number of references (N_references), number of citations
(N_citations), journal impact factor (journal_IF), and the year the journal
impact factor was released (journal_IF_year).  Finally the date of the scrape
is also provided (date_scraped). Bulleted abstracts or those with subheadings
or subparagraphs will not be extracted properly.

\examples{
\dontrun{

# use DOI to scrape number of WOS citations of a research article
data(example_references_metagear)
someRefs <- effort_initialize(example_references_metagear)
theWOSRef <- scrape_bibliography(someRefs$DOI[1])
print(paste("citations = ", theWOSRef$N_citations))

}
