\title{Plots and creates a PRISMA flow diagram.}
\usage{
plot_PRISMA(
  aPhaseVector,
  colWidth = 30,
  excludeDistance = 0.8,
  design = "classic",
  hide = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{aPhaseVector}{A vector of ordered labels (strings) for each phase of
the PRISMA diagram.  Labels designating the beginning of the diagram
are commented with "START_PHASE: " and those designating exclusion phases
"EXCLUDE_PHASE: ".  These comments will be removed from the diagram.}

\item{colWidth}{An optional value (integer) designating the width of the text 
box of each phase.}

\item{excludeDistance}{An optional value designating the the distance of 
exclude phase box from the main flow diagram.  Larger values (> 0.8) 
increase this distance.}

\item{design}{Designates the colorscheme and design of the the flow diagram.
The default is \code{classic} (as in versions of metagear prior to v. 0.4).
Others schemes are also available with color and more flat designs, and these
can be further customized; see NOTE below for these details.}

\item{hide}{When FALSE, the PRISMA flow diagram is not plotted.}
}
\value{
a grid object (grob) list
}
\description{
Creates a PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and 
   Meta-Analyses) flow diagram depicting the 'flow' of study inclusions and
   exclusions during various systematic review phases.  It is meant to 
   describe the number of studies identified, included, excluded, reasons
   for inclusion/exclusions, and final number of studies used in the
   meta-analysis.  NOTE: currently only supports two start phases, and final
   phase must not have an exclude branch.
}
\note{
\strong{Using canned or custom PRISMA design layouts}\cr\cr There are 
   several color schemes and design layouts (e.g. curved or flat) available. 
   These designs include: \code{cinnamonMint}, \code{sunSplash}, \code{pomegranate},
   \code{vintage}, \code{grey}, and \code{greyMono}. Custom schemes can also 
   be developed by modifying each aspect of the design.  These are:
   \describe{
       \item{S}{color of start phases (default: white)}
       \item{P}{color of the main phases (default: white)}
       \item{E}{color of the exclusion phases (default: white)}
       \item{F}{color of the final phase (default: white)}
       \item{fontSize}{the size of the font (default: 12) }
       \item{fontColor}{the font color (default: black)}
       \item{fontFace}{either plain, bold, italic, or bold.italic (default: plain)}
       \item{flatArrow}{arrows curved when FALSE (default); arrows square when TRUE}
       \item{flatBox}{boxes curved when FALSE (default); Boxes square when TRUE}
   } 
   For example, changing the defaults to have red rather than white exclusion 
   phases, and square boxes, would be: \code{design = c(E = "red", flatBox = TRUE)}.

\examples{
phases <- c("START_PHASE: # of studies identified through database searching",
            "START_PHASE: # of additional studies identified through other sources",
            "# of studies after duplicates removed",
            "# of studies with title and abstract screened",
            "EXCLUDE_PHASE: # of studies excluded",
            "# of full-text articles assessed for eligibility",
            "EXCLUDE_PHASE: # of full-text excluded, not fitting eligibility criteria",
            "# of studies included in qualitative synthesis",
            "EXCLUDE_PHASE: # studies excluded, incomplete data reported",
            "final # of studies included in quantitative synthesis (meta-analysis)")
