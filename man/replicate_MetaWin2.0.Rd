\title{Replicate meta-analysis results and summaries from MetaWin 2.0.}
\usage{
replicate_MetaWin2.0(
  model,
  weights,
  effects_model = "random",
  data,
  bootstraps = 999
)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{A two-sided linear formula object describing the model, with the
response (effect sizes) on the left of a ~ operator and the moderator 
variables, separated by +, :, * operators, on the right.  NOTE:  
MetaWin was limited to analyses with a single moderator variable.  
This function currently supports only categorical moderators.}

\item{weights}{A vector of effect size variances that will be used as 
weights for the meta-analysis.}

\item{effects_model}{The default is \code{"random"}, which specifies a 
random-effects meta-analysis.  Other options include \code{"fixed"} 
which presents fixed-effect analyses.}

\item{data}{An optional data frame containing the variables named in model
and weights.}

\item{bootstraps}{The number of bootstraps used to estimate confidence 
intervals.  As with 'MetaWin' 2.0, the default is 999.}
