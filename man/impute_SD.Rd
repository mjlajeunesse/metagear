\title{Imputes missing standard deviations in a dataset.}
\usage{
impute_SD(
  aDataFrame,
  columnSDnames,
  columnXnames,
  method = "Bracken1992",
  range = 3,
  M = 1
)
}
\arguments{
\item{aDataFrame}{A data frame containing columns with missing SD's (coded as 
\code{NA}) and their complete means (used only for nearest-neighbor method).}

\item{columnSDnames}{Label of the column(s) with missing SD.  Can be a string 
or list of strings.}

\item{columnXnames}{Label of the column(s) with means (X) for each SD.  Can be 
a string or list of strings.  Must be complete with no missing data.}

\item{method}{The method used to impute the missing SD's.  The default is 
\code{"Bracken1992"} which applies Bracken's (1992) approach to impute SD using
the coefficient of variation from all complete cases.  Other options include:
\code{"HotDeck"} which applies Rubin and Schenker's (1991) resampling approach to
fill gaps of missing SD from the SD's with complete information, and 
\code{"HotDeck_NN"} which resamples from complete cases with means that are similar
to missing SD's.}

\item{range}{A positive number on the range of neighbours to sample from for
imputing SD's.  Used in combination with \code{"HotDeck_NN"}. The default 
is 3; which indicates that the 3 means that are most similar in rank order
to the mean with the missing SD will be resampled.}

\item{M}{The number of imputed datasets to return.  Currently only works
for \code{"HotDeck"} method.}
}
\value{
An imputed (complete) dataset.

\description{
Imputes (fills gaps) of missing standard deviations (SD) using simple imputation
methods following Bracken (1992) and Rubin and Schenker's (1991) "hot deck" 
approach.
